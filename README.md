Student projects 2020 - Word
## About the project
-"Word" is an interactive game for children that will help them learn and use the Macedonian alphabet more easily. The aim of the game is forming words with the letters available to you,so you can collect points to win the game.

## Rules of the game
The game consists of 101 cards, a Icosahedron (twenty-side "cube") and an element that will display the player's lives. A letter is displayed on each card, and its value is determined by how many angles that letter has. At the beginning, each player gets 5 lives and 7 cards in hand and tries to make a word with those cards. The sum of the angles of the letters of the word that the player will represent represents the number of points. These points are written down. Then the cube rotates and depending on whether the number of the cube is greater or less than the number of points the player loses / does not lose a life.
The player who first reaches 101 points or remains the only one with lives in the game, wins.
